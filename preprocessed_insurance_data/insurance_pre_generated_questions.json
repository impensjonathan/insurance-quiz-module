Option C describes the role of a reserving actuary.

            "A": "To simplify the insurance policy documentation and to spread the administrative workload.",

        "explanation": "The text explicitly states that distributing risk can help ensure placement for all the (sub) risks the client wants covered. It also mentions that using multiple insurers can help achieve a better agreement on premium and risk acceptance, implying a potential reduction in the overall premium quote compared to using a single insurer.
