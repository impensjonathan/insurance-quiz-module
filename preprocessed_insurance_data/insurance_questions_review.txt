Focal Chunk Summary (up to 6 words): Insurance, reinsurance, and company focus.
Context Indices Used: [46, 101, 62]
Relevance Score: 5
Difficulty: Easy
Keywords: Reinsurance, Risk, Reward, Broker

Question: According to the text, what is a method an insurer can use to adjust their risk portfolio if the balance between risk and reward is unsatisfactory?
  A: Contacting regulatory bodies for risk assessment.
  B: Transferring a portion of their risk to a reinsurer via a broker, utilizing a reinsurance policy. (Correct)
  C: Increasing premiums across all existing policies to enhance reward.
  D: Directly investing in the stock market to diversify assets.

Explanation: The text explicitly states that if an insurer is unhappy with their risk-reward balance, they can "pass on part of their risk portfolio to a reinsurer through a broker, which is also called a reinsurance policy." Options A, C, and D are not mentioned as methods for managing risk-reward balance within the given context.

Focal Chunk Summary (up to 6 words): Reinsurer underwrites and prices risk.
Context Indices Used: [128, 63, 64]
Relevance Score: 5
Difficulty: Easy
Keywords: Reinsurance, Underwriting, Risk Assessment, Premium

Question: What action does a reinsurance company take before accepting a risk from an insurance company?
  A: Pays a reinsurance premium to the insurance company.
  B: Automatically accepts the risk presented by the broker.
  C: Conducts its own underwriting and risk assessment. (Correct)
  D: Immediately passes the risk on through retrocession.

Explanation: The text explicitly states that the reinsurance company "will perform its own underwriting, do their own risk assessment to price this specific risk" before accepting a risk. Option A describes the action of the insurance company, not the reinsurer. Option B is incorrect as the reinsurer assesses the risk before acceptance, not automatically. Option D is wrong as the reinsurer first accepts and may later decide to pass the risk through retrocession.

Focal Chunk Summary (up to 6 words): Insurer staffing varies; actuaries not always...
Context Indices Used: [48, 38, 61]
Relevance Score: 4
Difficulty: Easy
Keywords: Pricing actuary, Underwriter, Insurance relationship manager, Direct interaction

Question: According to the text, in a scenario where a client directly approaches an insurer, which professional supports the underwriter in determining appropriate pricing?
  A: Reserving actuary
  B: Insurance relationship manager
  C: Pricing actuary (Correct)
  D: Broker

Explanation: The text explicitly states that when a client goes directly to an insurer, "... the relationship manager is supported by an underwriter, who is supported by a pricing actuary..." This shows the pricing actuary's role in supporting the underwriting process, particularly concerning pricing. While a reserving actuary is mentioned, they are described as supporting the pricing actuary, not the underwriter directly. The insurance relationship manager handles client requests, and brokers are not involved in direct-to-insurer interactions as per the provided text.

Focal Chunk Index: 101
Focal Chunk Summary (up to 6 words): Two main types of treaty reinsurance.
Context Indices Used: [101, 102, 132]
Relevance Score: 5
Difficulty: Easy
Keywords: Pro-rata treaty, reinsurance, proportional, premiums

Question: Under a pro-rata treaty reinsurance agreement, how are losses and premiums shared between the primary insurer and the reinsurer?
  A: The reinsurer assumes all losses exceeding a pre-agreed limit, while premiums are shared equally.
  B: The primary insurer retains all losses, while the reinsurer receives a fixed percentage of the premiums.
  C: Losses and premiums are shared proportionally, based on a predetermined percentage agreed upon in the treaty. (Correct)
  D: The reinsurer assumes all losses up to a certain limit, and the primary insurer covers any losses exceeding that limit, while premiums are not shared.

Explanation: The text explicitly states that in a pro-rata treaty, "the primary insurer cedes a predetermined percentage of the risk to the reinsurer." It further explains that the reinsurer's share of losses is "proportional to the premiums and limits reinsured." This aligns only with option C. Option A describes an excess of loss arrangement. Options B and D do not reflect the proportional sharing described in the provided text.

Keywords: Facultative Reinsurance, Office Building, Risk Assessment, Insurance Policy

Question: An insurer is considering offering a €35 million policy on a large office building. Concerned about potential liabilities, the insurer seeks reinsurance before issuing the policy. Given the nature of the insured property, which type of reinsurance is the insurer MOST likely to pursue?
  A: Treaty Reinsurance
  B: Proportional Reinsurance
  C: Non-Proportional Reinsurance
  D: Facultative Reinsurance (Correct)

Explanation: The text explicitly links large, tangible assets like office buildings to facultative reinsurance. It explains that such properties allow for specific risk assessments, a characteristic of facultative reinsurance. The other options are not directly connected to the example of a specific building in the text.

QUESTION #9

Focal Chunk Index: 62
Focal Chunk Summary (up to 6 words): Reinsurance manages risk portfolio balance.
Context Indices Used: [62, 44, 63]
Relevance Score: 5
Difficulty: Easy
Keywords: Reinsurance, Risk Transfer, Portfolio Management, Reinsurer

Question: Why might a reinsurer seek out *another* reinsurer?
  A: To increase the overall premium volume of their business.
  B: To transfer risks they are uncomfortable holding in their portfolio. (Correct)
  C: To establish a broader network of client relationships.
  D: To compete directly with the primary insurance company that ceded the original risk.

Explanation: The text explicitly states that a reinsurer may seek out another reinsurance entity if they "have certain exposures, or risks they are not comfortable with" in their own portfolio. This suggests risk transfer as the primary motive. While increasing premium volume (A) might be a side effect, it's not the direct reason given. Option (C) is plausible but not supported by the provided text. Option (D) is incorrect as the reinsurer works *with* the ceding company, not against it, in risk management.

Focal Chunk Summary (up to 6 words): Reinsurance: Insurers insuring other insurers.
Context Indices Used: [41, 44, 63]
Relevance Score: 5
Difficulty: Easy
Keywords: Reinsurance, Premium, Risk Transfer, Reinsurer

Question: How does a reinsurer earn income in a reinsurance transaction?
  A: By selling insurance policies directly to individual clients.
  B: By receiving a reinsurance premium from the insurance company transferring the risk. (Correct)
  C: By investing the pooled premiums in the stock market.
  D: By charging fees for assessing the risk of the insurance company's portfolio.

Explanation: The text explicitly states that a reinsurer "accepts the risk and is paid a reinsurance premium by the insurance company." This mirrors the client-insurer relationship where the insurer receives a premium in exchange for taking on the client's risk. Options A, C, and D are not mentioned in the provided context as methods for reinsurer income generation. RelevanceScore: 5

Focal Chunk Index: 36
Focal Chunk Summary (up to 6 words): Actuarial reserving predicts future losses.
Context Indices Used: [36, 33, 37]
Relevance Score: 5
Difficulty: Easy
Keywords: reserving actuary, pricing actuary, pricing models, loss development

Question: How does the work of a reserving actuary contribute to the pricing actuary's role?
  A: The reserving actuary determines the final amount of reserves set aside, which directly dictates the premiums set by the pricing actuary.
  B: The reserving actuary's insights into historical loss development inform the pricing actuary's development of pricing models. (Correct)
  C: The reserving actuary identifies potential risks for underwriting, allowing the pricing actuary to adjust premiums accordingly.
  D: The reserving actuary calculates shareholder rewards, which are factored into premium calculations by the pricing actuary.

Explanation: The provided text states that "insights from the reserving actuary are typically also considered by the pricing actuary in developing their pricing models." This directly supports option B. Option A is incorrect because the reserving actuary informs the process but the management board makes the final decision on reserves. Option C is incorrect because risk identification for underwriting is described as the focus of the *pricing* actuary using exposure modeling. Option D is incorrect, as the reserving actuary's calculations enable appropriate reserve allocation, indirectly influencing shareholder rewards and premiums but not through direct calculation of those rewards themselves.

Context Indices Used: [44, 62, 98]
Relevance Score: 5
Difficulty: Easy
Keywords: Reinsurance, Risk Assessment, Portfolio, Loss Development

Question: How does a reinsurer typically evaluate the risk associated with a potential reinsurance agreement?
  A: By assessing the risk of each individual policy within the cedent's portfolio.
  B: By considering the combined premium and historical loss experience of the entire portfolio or sub-portfolio offered for reinsurance. (Correct)
  C: By relying solely on the original insurer's risk assessment for each policy.
  D: By focusing primarily on the reinsurer's own existing portfolio and its potential overlap with the offered reinsurance.

Explanation: The text explicitly states that a reinsurer "will look at the whole book... and make the risk assessment at that portfolio or sub-portfolio level looking at the combined premium and past loss development." This contrasts with evaluating individual policies (A) or solely relying on the primary insurer's assessment (C). While a reinsurer's own portfolio is a factor in their overall risk management, the primary evaluation for a *specific* reinsurance agreement is focused on the offered portfolio (D).

Keywords: Reinsurance, Broker, Risk Transfer, Premium

Question: What is the primary role of a broker in the reinsurance process, as described in the text?
  A: To evaluate the financial stability of reinsurance companies.
  B: To set the reinsurance premium rates.
  C: To connect insurers seeking to transfer risk with reinsurers willing to assume it. (Correct)
  D: To underwrite the original insurance policies before they are reinsured.

Explanation: The text consistently emphasizes the broker's role as a "dealmaker" who finds reinsurance companies willing to take on risks for insurers in exchange for premiums. The text doesn't mention brokers evaluating financial stability (A), setting premium rates (B), or underwriting original policies (D).

Focal Chunk Summary (up to 6 words): Reinsurers share risk through retrocession.
Context Indices Used: [64, 44, 85]
Relevance Score: 5
Difficulty: Easy
Keywords: Reinsurance, Retrocession, Risk portfolio, Risk transfer

Question: What is the term for the process when a reinsurer transfers part of its risk portfolio to another reinsurer?
  A: Reinsurance underwriting
  B: Risk portfolio optimization
  C: Retrocession (Correct)
  D: Primary insurance placement

Explanation: The provided text explicitly defines retrocession as the process where a reinsurer passes on risk to another reinsurer. This is analogous to reinsurance, but at a higher level in the risk transfer chain. Reinsurance underwriting is the process of evaluating and accepting reinsurance risks. Risk portfolio optimization is the overall goal of managing and balancing the risks within a portfolio, not the specific act of transferring risk. Primary insurance placement refers to the initial transfer of risk from the insured to the primary insurer.

Focal Chunk Summary (up to 6 words): Reinsurance treaty coverage limits.
Context Indices Used: [103, 135, 117]
Relevance Score: 5
Difficulty: Medium
Keywords: reinsurance, retention limit, policy limit, claims

Question: An insurance company has a retention limit of $25 million. They receive a request for a $35 million policy. They secure reinsurance treaties for the excess amount from multiple reinsurers. If a claim of $30 million occurs, how much will the reinsurers collectively pay?
  A: $35 million
  B: $30 million
  C: $5 million (Correct)
  D: $25 million

Explanation: The insurance company's retention limit is $25 million, meaning they cover up to that amount. The policy is for $35 million, and the excess amount ($35 million - $25 million = $10 million) is covered by reinsurance. Since the claim is $30 million, it falls within the total insured amount. The insurer pays the first $25 million (their retention limit), and the reinsurers collectively pay the remaining $5 million. RelevanceScore: 5

Keywords: Reinsurance, Treaty Policy, Risk Transfer, Portfolio

Question: A reinsurer receives a treaty policy covering a portfolio of commercial property risks. Which statement best describes the reinsurer's potential actions regarding this assumed risk?
  A: The reinsurer must accept the entire portfolio of risks without any further risk transfer.
  B: The reinsurer can choose to accept only a portion of the risk or further reinsure parts of the portfolio. (Correct)
  C: The reinsurer is obligated to individually price each policy within the portfolio before acceptance.
  D: The reinsurer can only reinsure risks from the portfolio that were written before the treaty agreement.

Explanation: The text states that the reinsurer "can choose as well to only take a certain slice of that risk," meaning they can accept a portion. It also mentions that the reinsurer can pass on pieces of their portfolio to another insurance entity (their reinsurer), allowing further risk transfer. Option A is incorrect because the reinsurer is not obligated to accept the entire risk. Option C is incorrect as treaty policies avoid individual policy pricing. Option D is incorrect as the treaty covers both existing and future policies within the defined criteria. RelevanceScore: 5

Question: According to the text, what is a primary advantage of using reinsurance for managing risks, as compared to the alternative approach?
  A: It allows insurers to completely eliminate all risk from their portfolios.
  B: It provides a quicker and more efficient method of risk management. (Correct)
  C: It necessitates the immediate cessation of underwriting new, similar risks.
  D: It encourages insurers to not renew any existing policies, reducing overall exposure.

Explanation: The text explicitly states that using reinsurance is "a much faster and more efficient way to manage risks" compared to the alternative of halting underwriting and non-renewal of existing risks. Options A, C, and D describe actions associated with the *alternative* approach mentioned, not the advantages of reinsurance itself.

Difficulty: Medium
Keywords: Pro-rata treaty, Surplus share, Quota share, Reinsurance

Question: In a surplus share pro-rata reinsurance treaty, how is the risk shared between the primary insurer (cedent) and the reinsurer?
  A: The risk and premium are shared based on a fixed percentage for each risk.
  B: The primary insurer retains a fixed amount of the risk, and the reinsurer takes the remainder. (Correct)
  C: The reinsurer determines the percentage of risk to assume on a case-by-case basis.
  D: The risk is shared equally between the primary insurer and reinsurer, regardless of the policy specifics.

Explanation: The text explicitly states that in a surplus share treaty, "the cedant retains a fixed amount instead of a percentage." This implies the reinsurer takes the remaining risk. Option A describes quota share, not surplus share. Options C and D are not mentioned in relation to surplus share treaties.

Question: What defines an Aggregate Excess of Loss (XOL) reinsurance treaty?
  A: It covers a portion of each individual loss exceeding a specific limit, applied per loss event.
  B: It covers the aggregate sum of all losses that exceed a pre-defined retention amount within a specified time period. (Correct)
  C: It proportionally shares the losses and premiums between the insurer and reinsurer for each individual risk.
  D: It provides coverage only for catastrophic losses exceeding a very high attachment point, regardless of the total accumulated losses.

Explanation: The text defines an Aggregate XOL treaty as covering losses that "exceed a predetermined aggregate retention […] occurring during a certain time period." This aligns with option B. Option A describes a per-loss XOL treaty, not an aggregate one. Option C describes pro rata reinsurance. Option D, while potentially describing a form of XOL, doesn't incorporate the crucial aggregate and time period element specific to the definition provided. RelevanceScore: 5

  C: It helps assess pricing adequacy and underwriting performance by comparing claims paid to premiums earned. (Correct)
  D: It reflects the ratio of administrative expenses to the total revenue generated by the company.

Explanation: The text defines the loss ratio as the ratio of incurred losses to earned premiums and explains that it is used to measure profitability, risk exposure, and underwriting efficiency. It specifically states that "It helps insurers evaluate pricing adequacy by comparing incurred claims to earned premiums."

Context Indices Used: [98, 44, 128]
Relevance Score: 5
Difficulty: Easy
Keywords: Reinsurance, risk assessment, portfolio underwriting, loss development

Question: How does a reinsurer typically assess the risk when considering a reinsurance agreement?
  A: By focusing on individual policies within the insurer's book of business, evaluating each policy's risk independently.
  B: By considering the combined premium and past loss development of the entire portfolio or sub-portfolio offered for reinsurance. (Correct)
  C: By solely relying on the original insurer's risk assessment and pricing information.
  D: By deferring all risk assessment to a third-party reinsurance specialist.

Explanation: The provided text states that a reinsurer "will look at the whole book... and make the risk assessment at that portfolio or sub-portfolio level looking at the combined premium and past loss development." This indicates that the reinsurer conducts its own independent assessment of the entire portfolio offered by the ceding company, rather than relying solely on the insurer’s previous calculations (C) or evaluating individual policies (A). The text also doesn’t suggest the involvement of a third-party specialist for this initial risk assessment process (D).

Question: How does a reinsurer typically assess the risk of a book of home insurance policies offered by a primary insurer?
  A: By meticulously evaluating each individual home policy within the book to determine its specific risk profile.
  B: By calculating the combined premium and analyzing past loss development for the entire portfolio or sub-portfolio. (Correct)
  C: By conducting on-site inspections of a representative sample of homes within the book to assess their vulnerability.
  D: By relying solely on the primary insurer's assessment of the overall risk associated with the book.

Explanation: The provided text explicitly states that reinsurers assess risk at the portfolio or sub-portfolio level, considering the combined premium and past loss development, rather than examining each individual policy.

Explanation: The text consistently describes the broker as a "deal maker" who "tries to find the right reinsurance company" or "looks in the market for a reinsurance company" willing to take on the risk an insurer wants to cede. This clearly points to the broker's role as a facilitator connecting the two parties.

Context Indices Used: [127, 133, 131]
Relevance Score: 5
Difficulty: Medium
Keywords: Facultative reinsurance, risk assessment, reinsurance arrangement, large building

Question: An insurer is considering offering a €35 million policy on a large office building but wants to limit its own potential payout to €25 million. Which reinsurance arrangement would be most appropriate for the insurer to use in this situation?
  A: Treaty reinsurance, as it automatically covers a portion of all policies within a defined category.
  B: Facultative reinsurance, as it allows the insurer to negotiate coverage for the specific risk of this particular building. (Correct)
  C: Proportional reinsurance, where the reinsurer shares a predetermined percentage of all losses on the policy.
  D: Non-proportional reinsurance, where the reinsurer covers losses only above a certain threshold.

Explanation: The text states that for large, tangible assets like office buildings, facultative reinsurance is used. This type of reinsurance involves a dedicated risk assessment of the specific property and allows the insurer to negotiate coverage for this individual risk, helping them limit their own potential payout. Treaty reinsurance covers a broader category of policies automatically, and while proportional and non-proportional are types of reinsurance, they don't address the insurer's need to tailor coverage for a specific high-value property.

Keywords: Reinsurance, Broker, Risk Transfer, Premium

Question: What is the primary role of a broker in reinsurance and retrocession transactions, as described in the text?
  A: To assess and underwrite the risk being transferred.
  B: To set the reinsurance premium rates independently.
  C: To facilitate the transfer of risk between insurers and reinsurers by finding suitable reinsurance agreements. (Correct)
  D: To directly assume the risk from the original insurer.

Explanation: The text consistently describes the broker as a "deal maker" who helps insurers and reinsurers optimize their risk portfolios. They achieve this by finding reinsurance companies willing to take on portions of risk for a certain premium, effectively facilitating the risk transfer. The broker doesn't underwrite the risk (A), set premium rates (B), or assume the risk themselves (D).

Question: What distinguishes facultative reinsurance from other forms of reinsurance?
  A: It covers all policies submitted by the ceding company.
  B: It involves a standardized contract covering a broad class of risks.
  C: It requires individual underwriting of specific risks or defined packages of risks. (Correct)
  D: It automatically reinsures all policies within a pre-agreed category.

Explanation: The text emphasizes that in facultative reinsurance, the reinsurer performs its own underwriting for each risk or a defined package of risks. It is a "one-off" agreement related to a specific risk rather than a broad category. This contrasts with options A and D, which describe automatic coverage, and option B, which suggests a standardized approach.

Question: An insurer has a pro-rata reinsurance treaty covering 75% of their home insurance policies up to a €100 million premium limit. If the insurer writes €150 million worth of home insurance premiums, what portion of the *next* €10 million in claims would the reinsurer be responsible for under this *specific* treaty?
  A: €7. 5 million
  B: €10 million
  C: €2. 5 million
  D: €0 (Correct)

Explanation: The reinsurance treaty in the example explicitly covers up to a €100 million premium limit. Any business written beyond that limit (€150 million total - €100 million limit = €50 million excess) is not covered by *this particular* treaty, as the text explains the insurer retains full responsibility for the excess unless a separate reinsurance arrangement is made. Therefore, the reinsurer's responsibility for claims on the next €10 million (part of the excess €50 million) under *this specific* treaty would be €0. RelevanceScore: 5

Question: An insurer has a pro-rata reinsurance treaty covering 75% of their home insurance policies up to a €100 million premium limit. The insurer writes €150 million worth of home insurance premiums. Assuming no additional reinsurance treaties are in place, what portion of the €150 million in premiums will the insurer retain?
  A: €25 million
  B: €50 million (Correct)
  C: €75 million
  D: €100 million

Explanation: The reinsurance treaty covers 75% of the first €100 million in premiums, meaning the insurer retains 25% of that €100 million (€25 million). The treaty does *not* cover any premiums beyond the €100 million limit. Therefore, the insurer retains 100% of the remaining €50 million.

Question: An insurer has an excess of loss reinsurance treaty with a retention of $2 million and a limit of $10 million. A loss event occurs resulting in a $7 million claim. How much of the claim will the reinsurer pay?
  A: $2 million
  B: $5 million (Correct)
  C: $7 million
  D: $10 million

Explanation: The retention is the amount the insurer covers initially ($2 million). The reinsurer covers the excess loss above the retention, up to the limit of the treaty. In this case, the loss is $7 million, so the reinsurer pays $7 million - $2 million = $5 million. The reinsurer's liability is capped at the treaty limit, which is $10 million, but since the excess loss is only $5 million, that is the amount paid.

Question: How does a reinsurer typically handle risk assessment and pricing in a treaty reinsurance agreement?
  A: The reinsurer individually underwrites and prices every policy within the cedant's portfolio.
  B: The reinsurer relies on the cedant's existing pricing and underwriting, reviewing overall premiums and policy wording against past losses. (Correct)

Question: In the reinsurance market, what is the primary role of a broker acting as an intermediary between an insurer and a reinsurer?
  A: Evaluating the financial stability of the reinsurer on behalf of the client.
  B: Setting the premium rates for the reinsurance contract independently.
  C: Finding a reinsurer willing to assume a portion of the insurer's risk for a specific premium. (Correct)
  D: Directly transferring the risk from the insurer to the reinsurer without negotiation.

Explanation: The provided text explicitly states that the broker "goes and looks in the market for a reinsurance company which is willing to take up that piece of risk for a certain premium amount." This describes the broker's role as a dealmaker, finding a suitable reinsurance partner for the insurer. Option A is not supported by the text. Option B is incorrect as the broker facilitates negotiation, but doesn't independently set rates. Option D is wrong as negotiation for premiums is a key part of the process. RelevanceScore: 5

Question: An insurance company has an Excess of Loss (XOL) reinsurance treaty with a retention of $2 million and a limit of $8 million. During a policy period, the company incurs losses of $9 million. How much will the reinsurer pay?
  A: $2 million
  B: $7 million (Correct)
  C: $8 million
  D: $9 million

Explanation: The XOL treaty covers losses *exceeding* the retention up to the limit. The losses are $9 million, exceeding the $2 million retention. The reinsurer covers the difference up to the $8 million limit. Therefore, the reinsurer pays $9 million - $2 million = $7 million. While the total losses are $9 M, the reinsurer’s liability is capped at $7 million because of the $8 million treaty limit.

Question: In the provided reinsurance scenario for home insurance policies, what is the reinsurer's typical approach to evaluating the risk of the ceded policies bundled within the treaty?
  A: The reinsurer individually underwrites each home policy within the treaty to precisely assess its specific risk.
  B: The reinsurer relies on the insurer's overall risk assessment for the entire book of business without examining individual policies. (Correct)
  C: The reinsurer conducts on-site inspections of a representative sample of homes covered under the treaty.
  D: The reinsurer negotiates a premium based on the historical loss ratios of similar policies in the region, disregarding the specific composition of the current ceded book.

Explanation: The text explicitly states the reinsurer *does not* evaluate each individual home policy due to time and cost constraints. Instead, the treaty covers a book of business (a collection of policies) related to a specific characteristic (e. g., location prone to floods), and the reinsurer takes on the risk of this entire book.

Question: In treaty reinsurance, how does the reinsurer typically assess the pricing adequacy of the risks within the cedant's portfolio?
  A: The reinsurer individually underwrites and prices each policy in the cedant's portfolio.
  B: The reinsurer relies on the pricing expertise of the cedant's underwriters and actuaries and reviews the overall premium and policy wording against historical loss experience. (Correct)
  C: The reinsurer conducts a comprehensive on-site audit of the cedant's underwriting and pricing practices.
  D: The reinsurer uses sophisticated statistical modeling independent of the cedant's data to project future losses.

Explanation: The text explicitly states that for treaty reinsurance, the reinsurer relies on "the pricing capabilities of the cedants’ underwriters and actuaries and reviews the overall premium and policy wording (contract terms) versus past loss developments."

Question: An insurance company identifies a concentration of home insurance policies in a flood-prone region, creating an undesirable risk. Which strategy, in conjunction with reinsurance, is described in the text to mitigate this risk?
  A: Increase premiums for all home insurance policies nationally to compensate for potential flood losses.
  B: Underwrite more policies in less flood-prone areas and fewer in the high-risk region, potentially adjusting premiums. (Correct)
  C: Immediately cancel all policies in the flood-prone region to eliminate the concentrated risk.
  D: Transfer all existing home insurance policies, regardless of location, to a reinsurance company.

Explanation: The text describes a combined approach: utilizing reinsurance for a specific subset of policies (those in the flood-prone area) *and* actively adjusting underwriting practices to reduce new exposures in that high-risk zone while seeking more business in lower-risk areas. This involves increasing premiums in the flood-prone area to deter new policies and discourage renewals, and potentially reducing premiums in less flood-prone areas to attract more business there. Option A is incorrect as it suggests a national premium increase, not targeted at the specific area. Option C is too drastic; the text discusses managing the risk, not eliminating it entirely by immediate cancellation.

Question: An insurer wants to reinsure only the claims related to fire damage within their home insurance portfolio, which includes other covered perils like water damage. Which type of Excess of Loss (XOL) reinsurance treaty would be most appropriate for this specific need?
  A: Aggregate XOL treaty
  B: Per risk XOL treaty (Correct)

Question: An insurer has an Aggregate Excess of Loss treaty with a retention of $5 million and a limit of $20 million for a one-year period. During that year, the insurer experiences total losses of $22 million. How much will the reinsurer pay?
  A: $5 million

The treaty specifies a 25%/75% split for premium and claims costs between the insurer (ceding company) and reinsurer. If the insurer writes €150 million in home insurance premiums, how much of the claim cost from the first €100 million will be covered by the reinsurer?

Explanation: The reinsurance treaty covers the first €100 million, with a 75%/25% split between the reinsurer and the insurer respectively. This means for the first €100 million, the reinsurer covers 75% of the claim costs.

This implies a coordinating and influential role, not a dictatorial (A) or purely contract-focused one (D). The text doesn't mention proportional division of claims (C). RelevanceScore: 5

Focal Chunk Summary (up to 6 words): Risk distribution across multiple insurers.
Context Indices Used: [82, 77, 65]
Relevance Score: 5
Difficulty: Easy
Keywords: Broker, Risk Transfer, Premium, Insurers

Question: According to the text, what are two reasons a broker might distribute a client's risk across multiple insurers?
  A: To simplify administrative processes and reduce the need for reinsurance.
  B: To find insurers willing to accept the risk and potentially lower the overall premium. (Correct)
  C: To adhere to regulatory requirements regarding risk diversification and ensure market competition.
  D: To increase the client's market visibility and attract more favorable insurance offers in the future.

Explanation: The text explicitly states that distributing risk can be advantageous because a single insurer might not accept the entire risk or might charge a too-high premium. Spreading the risk allows the broker to locate insurers willing to cover portions of the risk and potentially negotiate a lower overall premium compared to placing the whole risk with a single insurer. The other options are not supported by the provided text.

Focal Chunk Summary (up to 6 words): Insurance compensation structures explained.
Context Indices Used: [12, 23, 49]
Relevance Score: 5
Difficulty: Easy
Keywords: Broker, Commission, Insurer, Premium

Question: How does a broker typically earn income in the insurance market?
  A: By directly underwriting and assuming the risks associated with insurance policies.
  B: By receiving commissions from insurers for policies sold through their services. (Correct)
  C: By collecting premiums directly from clients and retaining a percentage before passing the rest to insurers.
  D: By processing and paying out claims on behalf of insurance companies.

Explanation: The text states that "insurers must pay a commission to brokers... for policies sold through them." This indicates that brokers act as intermediaries, facilitating the sale of policies and earning income through commissions paid by the insurers. Brokers do not underwrite risk (A), collect premiums directly (C), or handle claim payouts (D).

Focal Chunk Summary (up to 6 words): Insurance premiums for linked entities.
Context Indices Used: [280, 283, 279]
Relevance Score: 4
Difficulty: Medium
Keywords: primary client, linked entities, premium, multi-client policy

Question: In a scenario where a head office insures its chain of stores but the head office itself isn't covered, how might the premium payment be handled?
  A: The head office pays the entire premium and is then reimbursed by each store.
  B: Each store receives a separate invoice for their portion of the total premium, calculated based on factors like store size. (Correct)
  C: The premium is waived because the head office is the primary client but not covered.
  D: The insurer directly invoices the head office for a nominal fee, covering administrative costs.

Explanation: The text explains that in cases where the primary client (head office) doesn't utilize the coverage, the total premium can be "dispersed" across the linked entities (stores) using a key like store space. This implies separate invoices for each store reflecting their share, not a lump sum paid by the head office or a waived premium.

Focal Chunk Summary (up to 6 words): How insurance companies profit.
Context Indices Used: [16, 15, 17]
Relevance Score: 5
Difficulty: Easy
Keywords: Premiums, Investment income, Revenue, Insurance float

Question: An insurance company's primary revenue streams come from which two sources?
  A: Underwriting profits and policyholder dividends.
  B: Premium income and investment returns on premiums. (Correct)
  C: Sales of insurance policies and government subsidies.
  D: Claim payouts and commissions from reinsurers.

Explanation: The text explicitly states that an insurance company makes money by "Investing the premiums" and "Profits from collecting premiums as revenue when they exceed expenses." This corresponds to premium income and the returns earned by investing those premiums. Option A is incorrect as policyholder dividends represent a return of profits *to* policyholders, not a revenue stream *for* the company. Option C is wrong because government subsidies are not mentioned. Option D is incorrect; claim payouts are expenses, not revenue, and commissions are paid *by* insurers, not received from reinsurers in this context. RelevanceScore: 5

  A: The end client of the second broker.
  B: The insurance carrier (insurer).
  C: The second broker (the 3 rd party broker). (Correct)
  D: A regulatory body overseeing insurance transactions.

Explanation: The provided text explicitly states, "the invoice of the broker goes to the other broker, not the other broker’s client." This clarifies that the invoice is sent directly to the second broker involved in the wholesale arrangement, not the final client.
